# tinker-chili3d

Chili3D plugin for [Tinker](https://github.com/liriliri/tinker).

## About

This plugin integrates [Chili3D](https://github.com/xiangechen/chili3d), a web-based 3D CAD application for online model design and editing. Chili3D achieves near-native performance by compiling OpenCascade (OCCT) to WebAssembly and integrating with Three.js, enabling powerful online modeling, editing, and rendering directly in your browser.
