# tinker-jspaint

JSPaint plugin for [TINKER](https://github.com/liriliri/tinker).

## About

This plugin integrates [JS Paint](https://github.com/1j01/jspaint), a pixel-perfect web-based MS Paint remake, into TINKER. JS Paint faithfully recreates the classic Windows Paint experience with modern improvements like unlimited undo, transparent image editing, and touch support.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g tinker-jspaint
```
