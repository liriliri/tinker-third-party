# tinker-method-draw

Method Draw plugin for [Tinker](https://github.com/liriliri/tinker).

## About

This plugin integrates [Method Draw](https://github.com/methodofaction/Method-Draw), a web-based vector drawing application, into Tinker. Method Draw provides a simple and easy-to-use SVG editor experience. It purposely removes some features such as layers and line-caps/corners in exchange for a more streamlined and pleasant drawing experience, making it perfect for quick vector graphics creation and editing.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g tinker-method-draw
```
