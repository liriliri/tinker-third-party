## About

This plugin integrates [Blockbench](https://github.com/JannisX11/blockbench), a free modern model editor for low-poly and boxy models with pixel art textures. Blockbench is primarily used for Minecraft and entity modeling, but it also supports general 3D modeling and animation with features for texturing, animating, and exporting to various formats.
